# About
Ongoing project/development - Drupal 9 module meant to be a "container" for various UI components/formatters. It implements plenty of Block plugins, Views plugins (such as arguments, filters, displays styles), a front-end factory (to support theme and modules) then a also more goodies like Swiper.js, Animate.css libraries integrations in Drupal etc. There is a reasonable starting point for to expand into an actual Drupal theme as well - some templates and CSS classes provided, some front-end like tools - but for the moment without actual control from Drupal admin UI.
